## Build a Sandbox

Before analyzing malware, it’s recommended to build a sandbox for malware analysis.  
Below are useful tools for building such an environment.

- **FLARE VM**
    
    It is a collection of software installations scripts for Windows systems to maintain a reverse engineering environment on a virtual machine.
    
- **REMnux**
    
    A Linux toolkit for malware analysis.
    
- **[ANY.RUN](https://any.run/)**
    
    An interactive online malware sandbox.
    
- **[Hybrid Analysis](https://hybrid-analysis.com/)**
    
    A free online malware analysis.

## Get Information About Malware

First off, we get the hash of the malware.

```bash
# Linux
md5sum example
sha256sum example

# PowerShell
Get-FileHash -Algorithm MD5 example.exe
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 example.exe
```

We can use the hash for finding details of malware, so copy the output hash.

### Google Search

We can search the information about malware by searching the hash.

In search form, input the hash value as below.

```bash
"47BA62CE119F28A55F90243A4DD8D324"
```

Now access to websites listed the search result.

### VirusTotal

VirusTotal analyses suspicious files, domains, IPs and URLs to detect malware and
 other breaches, automatically share them with the security community.  
To search the information about suspicious files, first get the hash in our terminal.

### MalwareBazaar in Abuse.ch

[MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/) also analyses suspicious files.

We can input the hash in Browse Database as below.

```bash
md5:47BA62CE119F28A55F90243A4DD8D324
```

## Resource Hacker

Resource Hacker is a resource extraction utility and resource compiler for Windows.

By opening a malware file, we can retrieve detail information about the file in “Version Info”.

### CAPA

[capa](https://github.com/mandiant/capa) detects capabilities in executable files.

```bash
capa example.exe
# -vv: All feature match details
capa -vv example.exe
```

### Strings

We can find specific text contained in the malware.

```bash
# Linux
strings example | grep "text_here"

# PowerShell
strings example.exe | findstr "text_here"
```

            # Update first, then will add `signature-base` directory
            python ~/Loki/loki.py --update

            # Run
            python ~/Loki/loki.py -p ./suspicious_files_dir

            # Run & output a log file
            python loki.py -p ./suspicious_files_dir -l log.txt
            ```

        - **[yarGen](https://github.com/Neo23x0/yarGen)**

            ```sh
            # Update first
            python ~/yarGen/yarGen.py --update

            # Generate Yara ruls for specific file
            python ~/yarGen/yarGen.py -m ./suspicious_files_dir --excludegood -o ./suspicious_files_dir/rule.yar

            # Check if the file flagged
            yara ./suspicious_files_dir/rule.yar ./suspicious_files_dir/somefile.php

            # If flagged, copy this ruls to Loki's signature yara directory
            cp ./suspicious_files_dir/rule.yar ~/Loki/signature-base/yara

            # Then run Loki
            # ...
            ```

    - **Manual**

        - **Find Files Matches Rules**

            ```sh
            yara rule.yar ./somedir
            # Print only number of matches
            yara -c rule.yar ./somedir
            # Print only not satisfied rules 
            yara -n rule.yar ./somedir
            # Print metadata
            yara -m rule.yar ./somedir
            ```

        - **Create Rules**

            Create "rule.yar".

            ```txt
            rule rule_name {
                meta:
                    author = "pentester"
                    description = "test rule"
                    created = "6/20/2022 00:00"
                strings:
                    $hello = "Hello"
                    $text_file = ".txt"
                condition:
                    $hello and $text_file
            }
            ```

## Static Analysis

Static Analysis is a method of malware analysis that analyze without executing a suspicious file. It can detect basic information (e.g. packer, linker, architecture) of files but may be not enough.

```sh
strings example.exe
strings example.doc
```

- **[Detect It Easy](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy)**
    
    It determines types of files.
    
- **[CAPA](https://github.com/mandiant/capa](https://github.com/mandiant/capa)**
    
    It identifies capabilities in executable files.
    
    ```sh
    capa ./executable
    ```
    

If you found that the executable is packed with a packer tool such as UPX, unpack with the same packer tool and re-analyze the file using CAPA.  
For example, if the executable is packed with UPX, unpack with UPX and re-run capa.

```sh
upx -d ./executable
# Delete the cache of capa
del ./executable.viv
capa <suspicious-executable>
```

### Micrsoft OLE Files

```bash
# Check 'M' in the result of the oledump. It indicates the stream contains macro.
oledump example.doc
# -i: Print extra info
oledump -i example.doc
# -s a: Select item (stream) in nr for dumping (a for all)
# -v: Decompress VBA expressions
oledump -s a -v example.doc
olefile example.doc
oleid example.doc
olemeta example.doc
oleobj example.doc
oletimes example.doc
olevba example.doc
# --deobf: Deobfuscate VBA expressions.
# --decode: Display all the obfuscated strings with their decoded content.
olevba --deobf --decode example.doc
```

### Shellcode Analysis

[scdbg](http://sandsprite.com/blogs/index.php?uid=7&pid=152) is available for finding shellcode in Windows executables.

```bash
scdbg -f shellcode_file.sc
scdbg -f shellcode.sc -fopen bad.doc_ -s -1 -i
scdbg -f shellcode.doc -s -1
```

<br />

## Dynamic Analysis

If our environment is Windows, we need to start the Process Monitor before running the dynamic analysis.  
[Process Monitor (ProcMon)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) is a Windows tool that analyze the behavior (real-time registry, file system, and process/threat activity) while analyzing malware.  

In ProcMon, set “Process Name” “is” “executable.exe” then “Include” in the Process Monitor Filter, and click “Add” → “OK”.  

After executing, you should see results appear in the ProcMon.  
The first step is to unset all filters on the right of the tool bar, then set again a filter one by one.

- Show Registry Activity
    
    This filter allows us to determine if any significant Registry Modifications are executed by the binary.  To focus on Registry Key Creations and Modifications, exclude RegOpenKey, RegQueryValue, RegQueryKey, RegCloseKey by right-clicking on the row of results.
    
- Show File System Activity
    
    This filter allows us to determint if the malware executes File Creations. To focus only on File Write events, exclude CreateFile, CreateFileMapping, QuerySecurityFile, QueryNameInformationFile, QueryBasicInformationFile, CloseFile, ReadFile.
    
- Show Network Activity
    
    This filter allows us to confirm if the malware attempts to make a network connection.

## Malicious Document (.doc) Analysis

1. Open CyberChef
2. Upload the suspicious doc file on CyberChef.
3. Use the “Strings” function to extract strings.
4. If you found obfuscated strings in the results, add the “Find / Replace” function to remove extra strings.
5. If necessary, add the “Drop bytes” function to remove extra bytes.
