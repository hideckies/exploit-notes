## PE Headers

There are many tools to analyze PE headers, such as wxHexEditor, pe-tree.  
[pe-tree](https://github.com/blackberry/pe_tree) is a tool that views PE files in a tree-view. It will take about a few minutes to open.

```sh
pe-tree ./executable
```

- **IMAGE_DOS_HEADER**
    
    It consists of the first 64 bytes of the PE file. The first two bytes (”4D 5A”) means the “MZ” characters which are an identity of the Portable Executable format.
    
- **DOS_STUB**
    
    It is a small piece of code that only runs if the PE file is incompatible with the system it is being run on. At such time the message “!This program cannot be run in DOS mode" will be displayed.

- **IMAGE_NT_HEADERS**
    
    It contains most of the vital information related to the PE file. The starting address of the IMAGE_NT_HEADERS is found in `e_lfanew` from the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER.
    
    - **NT_HEADERS**

        - **Signature**
            
            The first 4 bytes of the NT_HEADERS consists of the Signature. It says “`50 45 00 00`" in hex, which means “PE” in ASCII. It indicates the start of the NT_HEADER.
            
        - **FILE_HEADER**
            
            It contains vital information, such as a type of architecture for which the PE file is written.
            
        - **OPTIONAL_HEADER**
            
            It contains the most important information in the PE headers. Especially, the AddressOfEntryPoint field is significant for reverse engineering.
            
            - **Magic**
                
                It tells whether the PE file is a 32-bit or 64-bit. 0x010B indicates 32-bit, and 0x020B indicates 64-bit.
                
    - **IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER**
        
        It contains various sections like .text, .data, .rsrc, etc.
        
    - **IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR**
        
        It contains information about  Windows APIs that the PE file loads when executed.

## Identify Packers of Packed Executable

[pecheck](https://github.com/DidierStevens/DidierStevensSuite/blob/master/pecheck.py) is a command-line tool which analyze PE files.

```sh
pecheck ./executable
```

When results appears, check the section name in the PE Section.
