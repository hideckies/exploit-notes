## Basic

For XORing, we can use **`^`** operator.

Here is Python script example to **XOR**.  
Also use the **XOR key** for xoring a target value.

```python
target = 21
xor_key = 2

print(target ^ xor_key)
# 23
```

The above operation does the following calculation internally.

1. Convert the decimal **`21`**  of the target to the binary (`10101`).
2. Convert the decimal **`2`** of the key to the binary (`00010`).
3. XOR the bits at each position as below.

```python
10101 # binary for 21
# XOR
00010 # binary for 2

# Result
10111 # binary for 23
```

By the way, each value can be replaced individually as follows.

```txt
a ^ b = c
a ^ c = b
b ^ c = a
```

In CTF, we may be able to use this principle to calculate the xor key.

### XOR Characters

We can also XOR each character.

```python
ord('a') ^ ord('b')
# 3
```

The above operation does the following calculation internally.

1. Convert the character ‘a’ to the Unicode `97`. It’s `1100001` in binary.
2. Convert the character ‘b’ to the Unicode `98`. It’s `1100010` in binary.
3. XOR the bits at each position as below.

```python
1100001 # binary for 'a'
# XOR
1100010 # binary for 'b'

# Result
0000011 # binary for 3
```

### XOR Strings

In addition, we can also XOR strings by XORing the bits at each position. 

```python
ciphertext = "5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592"
key = "secret"

# Convert each string to bytes
ciphertext_bytes = bytes.fromhex(ciphertext)
key_bytes = key.encode()

# XOR operation
xored_bytes = bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(ciphertext_bytes, key_bytes))

# Convert the result to Hex
xored_hex = xored_bytes.hex()

print("Result:", xored_hex)
```

The above operation does the following calculation.

1. Convert the ciphertext to the binary.
2. Convert the XOR key to the binary.
3. Loop each byte and XOR each one.
4. Convert the result bytes to Hex.

## XOR with Pwntools

We can easily **XOR** using the **`xor`** module of **`pwntools`**.  
First off, install **`pwntools`** if you don't have.

```python
pip install pwntools
```

To decrypt the encrypted text with **XOR**, write Python script such as below.

```python
from pwn import xor

ciphertext = "5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592"
key = "secret"

xored = xor(bytes.fromhex(ciphertext), key.encode())
```

## Brute Force XOR Key with 0/Null

If we specify **0** or **`\x00`** to the target value, the result is the key as it is.

```python
0 ^ 1 # result: 1
0 ^ 2 # result: 2
...
0 ^ 999 # result: 999
```

Using the principle, we may be able to get the **XOR key** by brute forcing.

```python
xor_key = b'secret'

null_payload = b''
for i in range(10):
    null_payload += b'\x00'
    result = bytes([a ^ b for a, b in zip(null_payload, xor_key)])
    print(result.decode())
```

The output of the above script will be the following:

```txt
s
se
sec
secr
secre
secret
secret
secret
secret
secret
```
