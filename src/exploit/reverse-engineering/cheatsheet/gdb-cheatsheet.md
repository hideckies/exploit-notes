## Using Enhanced GDB

It's recommended to use enhanced version of GDB such as [GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef). These have some extended features.

<br />

## Start Debugger

```bash
chmod +x ./example
gdb ./example
```

<br />

## Commands in GDB

### Debug

```bash
# Start the program
run
r

# Continue until the next breakpoint or the end
continue
c

# Execute the next line of code but do not enter any function calls on that line.
next
n

# Execute the next line of code
step
s

# Jump to specific address
j *0x01234
```

### Disassemble

```bash
# Switch the syntax
set disassembly-flavor att
set disassembly-flavor intel

# Disassemble the main function
disass main
```

### Breakpoints

```bash
# Set a breakpoint at a specified line number, function, or address.
break main
b main
break *0x12345678
# Add a breakpoint to the relative address position from the main function.
b *main+25

# Information about breakpoints
info breakpoints
i breakpoints
i b

# Delete all breakpoints
delete breakpoints
d breakpoints
# Delete the specified breakpoint
delete <breakpoint_number>
delete 1
d 1
```

### Values

```sh
# Print value of expression at specific address
p 0x01234

# Examine the memory as specific address as addresses
x/a 0x01234
# Examine the memory at specific address as 10 characters
x/10c 0x01234
# Examine the memory as specific address as string
x/s 0x01234
# Examine
x/g 0x01234

# Display information of registers
info registers
i r
# Display information of the stack frame
i f

# Display current Program Counter
info registers pc
```

### Change Values

```bash
# Set N characters to specific address
set {char [5]} 0x01234 = "Hello"

# Set the value stored at memory address `0x01234` to `0x5678`
set *0x01234 = 0x5678
```
